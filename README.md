The App has 4 features implemented
1. Sign Up - For new User Registration, with password hasing feature
2. Login - For existing User verified using email and password only
3. Reset-Password - To set password again, it works only if you are already logged in.
4. Logout - Logs you out from any step you are and redirects to home page.

To implement in your local system, just clone the repository, run npm install in root directory to install all dependencies, then finally run npm start and your application is ready to run on localhost
